Hello, I'm Meghna Mishra. Welcome to my Digital Garden. I have recently come across the whole concept of building a digital garden and here's [[digial garden/Why I am creating a digital garden\|Why I am creating a digital garden]] myself. 

I am not quite sure if I can provide a navigational path just yet since these are just going to be personal thoughts and feelings about the various entities that I come across in my mundane life. It can be as random as [[digial garden/Lessons I learned from travelling to college by bus for 3+ years\|Lessons I learned from travelling to college by bus for 3+ years]] or as specific as [[Why Dune (2021) hits the right spot between sci-fi and satire\|Why Dune (2021) hits the right spot between sci-fi and satire]].
