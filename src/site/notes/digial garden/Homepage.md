Hello, I'm Meghna Mishra. Welcome to my Digital Garden. I have recently come across the whole concept of building a digital knowledge garden and here's [[digial garden/Why I am creating a digital garden\|Why I am creating a digital garden]] for myself. 

I am not quite sure if I can provide a navigational path just yet since these are just going to be personal thoughts and feelings about the various incidents that I come across in my mundane life. It can be as random as [[digial garden/Lessons I learned from travelling to college by bus for 3+ years\|Lessons I learned from travelling to college by bus for 3+ years]] or as specific as [[Why Dune (2021) hits the right spot between sci-fi and satire\|Why Dune (2021) hits the right spot between sci-fi and satire]]. 

To be honest I stumbled upon Andy Mastuchak's About These Notes page and I was hooked. The way everything was linked and connected made me wonder if I can create something like that myself. As everything we see, do, think gets linked and contextualized in our heads.

I am on my way to pursue M.Tech in Biotechnology and one of the main skills that is very necessary in this field is the power of writing, coming up with and connecting ideas/thoughts. To articulate your thoughts is a real-life skill and this digital garden will be my way of developing just that.
